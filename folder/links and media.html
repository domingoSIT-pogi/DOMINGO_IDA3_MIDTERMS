                    <p>Carhartt, founded in 1889 in Michigan, has long been a symbol of durability and practicality in workwear. Originally designed for laborers, farmers, and outdoor workers, the brand became known for its tough, high-quality fabrics like duck canvas and denim, built to withstand the harshest conditions. Over the years, Carhartt expanded its appeal beyond the workplace, especially through its Carhartt WIP (Work In Progress) line, which combines the brand’s rugged legacy with a streetwear aesthetic. This blend of utility and style has made Carhartt a staple in both blue-collar and fashion-forward circles, maintaining its commitment to craftsmanship while embracing contemporary trends.
