            <p>*How to Train Your Dragon* (2010), directed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois, is an animated film based on Cressida Cowell's 2003 book. Set in a mythical Viking world, it follows Hiccup, a teen who wants to become a dragon slayer like his tribe. After capturing a rare Night Fury dragon, he chooses to befriend it instead of killing it. Naming the dragon Toothless, Hiccup discovers dragons aren’t the enemies his people believe. To protect Toothless, he sets out to change his tribe’s views. The film earned nearly $500 million globally and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.

            <p>**Cars** is a 2006 animated sports comedy film by Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Pictures, directed by John Lasseter and co-directed by Joe Ranft. Featuring the voices of Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, and Bonnie Hunt, the story is set in a world of anthropomorphic vehicles. It follows Lightning McQueen, a self-centered race car who gets stranded in the small town of Radiator Springs. There, he learns about friendship, humility, and what truly matters in life.
                The film was inspired by Lasseter's road trip experiences and originally began development in 1998 under the working title *The Yellow Car*. It was delayed in favor of *Toy Story 2*, then resumed with major script revisions. *Cars* premiered in May 2006 and grossed $462 million worldwide on a $120 million budget. It received generally positive reviews and two Academy Award nominations, winning a Golden Globe and Annie Award for Best Animated Feature. It was also the last independently produced Pixar film before Disney acquired the studio.
                *Cars* launched a successful franchise, including two sequels and the *Planes* spin-off films.
