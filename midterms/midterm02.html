    ## Reviewing user request  
    - The user is asking for a list, similar to a previous task that generated an HTML page.  
    - The previous output included movies with synopses, thumbnails, and links.  
    - The current request appears incomplete, cutting off at "Create a list."
    
    ## Clarifying task details  
    - The request is to create an HTML page listing 2-3 favorite movie titles, with synopses and 150x150 thumbnails on the same page.  
    - Thumbnails must link to their source references, and list items should link to their corresponding synopses.
